# Sentiment-Analysis Based Recommendation System Using Machine Learning Models
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or subjective tone expressed in a piece of text. It involves analyzing text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses, to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the underlying sentiment or attitude conveyed by the text. By using machine learning algorithms or lexicon-based approaches, sentiment analysis can automatically categorize text into different sentiment categories based on the emotional tone or polarity of the language used.
