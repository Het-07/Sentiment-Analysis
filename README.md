# Sentiment-Analysis Based Recommendation System Using Machine Learning Models
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment or subjective tone expressed in a piece of text. It involves analyzing text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, or survey responses, to classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.

The goal of sentiment analysis is to understand the underlying sentiment or attitude conveyed by the text. By using machine learning algorithms or lexicon-based approaches, sentiment analysis can automatically categorize text into different sentiment categories based on the emotional tone or polarity of the language used.

## Problem:

Day by day, demand in e-commerce is increasing. With the increasing demand in online stores, the voice of customer concepts such as reviews and customer experiences are getting more important because customers buy products without seeing or touching them. If the company fails to meet this need of customers, it loses money because of not taking strategic decisions.

## Aim:

Protect company from losing money with increasing customer satisfaction and giving importance to their feedback.

## Solution:

define good or bad products as quick as possible according to reviews and take action for this
For this solution, I worked on sentiment analysis with different models. The model predicts reviews as positive or negative from text.

recommend customers related products to increase satisfaction with decreasing search time for suitable product
I built recommendation system in this project for this solution.

## What Will These Solutions Bring to The Company?

easy product comparison
defining dislikes easily
saving time
more money with selling more products
happier customers = more customers = more money
less time on server = less problem

## Data:

In this project, I worked on sentiment analysis of Kindle Store reviews in Amazon. I choose this dataset because it is more easy to buy and read a book with Kindle. Going to the book store, finding a book which you like need more time than reaching every book from your tablet.
